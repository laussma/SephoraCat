Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent. <br>-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly. <br>-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent. <br>-Replace fragrance after 12 months.

The fragrance opens up with neroli and citrusy hints of mandarin and bergamot. At the heart is lavender, whichlike a Mediterranean breezeevokes a mother‘s fresh laundry and the classic essence of a father. Touches of tobacco and tonka bean provide structure for the last dry notes of wood.","Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent. -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.
